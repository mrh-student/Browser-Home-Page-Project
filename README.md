# HomeTab
After using the (free) Momentum browser home page for a while, I wanted to create my own to be able to personalise it more. 
This is an ongoing project, also used to try out new techniques from coding courses.<br><br>
I am currently running the page locally as the default browser home page / new tab page.<br>

#### Install
<p>To customise, the page needs your name, your location (for weather) and an <a href="https://openweathermap.org/appid#get">API key from openweathermap</a> (free option available). No affiliation, I just liked their weather data output the best.</p>

When `index.html` is loaded and no configuration information is found, `setup.html` is loaded. You can enter name, location and API key here. The values are stored in local storage. To test, you do not need to enter an API key, a default test key will be loaded.

<p>If you want to download HomeTab to use as a homepage, make sure to get your own API key at https://openweathermap.org/appid#get, the default test key is a free key and will be temporarily blocked after a certain amount of calls.</p>


<p>Other customisation options not included in setup are described below.</p>
<p>Once the page is customised to you, you can set it as the default home page / new tab page of your browser. No need to upload to a webspace, it can just run locally.</p>

To update info, visit `setup.html` by using the settings icon in the bottom left corner. 


#### Techniques used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### Tested in:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

<p>Best for larger screens > 1200px width<br>
Smallest dimensions to still look good is 1200 x 650 px<br>
More work on optimsation for smaller screens needed</p>

#### Features:

- Random screen filling background image

- Clock: shows current time in hours and minutes, updated every 0.5s
- Date: shows current date as 'weekday, month, date, year', updated every 0.5s
- User greeting: shows a custom greeting depending on the current time, updated every 1s
    - change the greetings and timeframes in index.js , `greet_user(user_name)` function

- Timezone Clocks: show current time in different locations around the world, updated every 0.5s
    - modify `get_times()` and `worldclock()` function in index.js to edit which cities / timezones to show

- Quote: Shows a random quote whenever the page is loaded / reloaded 
    - currently using `_.sample` so picks can repeat, no other fine-tuning
    - the quote box will show an expanding animation everytime the page is loaded / reloaded
    - get a new random quote by clicking on the quote
    - quotes are set in index.js, `get_quote()` function
    

- Weather: Shows the current temperature and condition using openweathermaps API, updates every 15min
    - You can set the location and API key for the call through setup.html / config.json
    - To customise update time modifiy the timeout in the `get_weather_open(location,openweatherAPI)` function (be careful since there is a daily/monthly limit for free API calls using openweathermaps )

- Change Background button: Change the background image to another random pick 
    - currently using `_.sample` so picks can repeat, no other fine-tuning

- To Do List: Add to do items, cross them off and/or delete them. More work required here: If an item is crossed off (not deleted) it will be loaded again as uncrossed when reloading page. Download / share list feature planned.   

- Search: bottom search bar searches Google for keyword in new tab



#### Notes:

index.js is referencing `images/bg001.jpg` - `images/bg011.jpg`<br>
Example images are included in the repository, but you can replace them with your own in the images folder<br>
Images are set in `random_bg()` function<br>
