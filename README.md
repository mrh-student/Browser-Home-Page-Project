# Browser Home Page
After using the (free) Momentum browser home page for a while, I wanted to create my own to be able to personalise it more. 
This is an ongoing project, also used to try out new techniques from coding courses.

#### Techniques used:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

#### Notes:

index.js is referencing images 'images/bg001.jpg' - 'images/bg010.jpg'
The images are not included in the repository, but you can replace them with your own

The To Do List widget will currently not save to do items once the page is reloaded - the best kind of to do list is the self-erasing kind.
